# Possible Improvments or documenting the needed. 

## Possible Improvments

**Optimize Orbit Drawing** <br>
Instead of recalculating the positions for orbit drawing every frame, you could update them at a lower frequency (e.g., every second) or when a certain condition is met (e.g., when the planet completes one orbit).

**Error Handling** <br>
Implement error handling for potential exceptions that may occur during runtime, such as division by zero or invalid user input.

**Efficient Resource Management** <br>
Ensure efficient resource management, such as releasing resources when they're no longer needed. For instance, remove event handlers once the simulation ends.

**Performance Optimization** <br>
Profile your code to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize them. For example, you could use Pygame's sprite system for rendering, which might improve performance compared to drawing individual shapes.

**Graphics Optimization** <br>
Explore graphics optimization techniques to improve rendering performance, such as batch rendering or using hardware acceleration features provided by Pygame.

**Rendering Optimizations** <br>
If computationally feasible, try rendering at a higher resolution followed by downscaling. Investigate libraries like PyCairo for potentially smoother drawing.

**Separate Simulation Logic** <br>
Create a class to encapsulate simulation logic (gravity calculations, updating positions) independently from display elements. This improves organization and makes modifications easier.

**More Accurate Gravity** <br>
You could directly use self.G in your gravity calculations and incorporate the masses of planets to make the interactions more physically realistic.

**Numerical Integration** <br>
Explore a more accurate integration method like Verlet integration. This can improve the long-term stability of your simulated orbits.

## Steps for improvments

### More Accurate Physics

Code optimization: 

<details>
    <summary>Incorporate G and Mass</summary>
        Modify your gravity calculation (attraction method) to directly use the gravitational constant G and consider the masses of interacting planets.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Exploration of Verlet Integration</summary>
        Research the Verlet integration method. While slightly more complex than your current approach, it offers better accuracy. We can start with a basic implementation and then refine it.
